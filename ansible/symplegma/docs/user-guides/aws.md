# Deploying on AWS

Symplegma supports AWS as a cloud provider.

## Architecture

`contrib/aws/` contains terraform file to deploy the following architecture. This is strongly opinionated and deploys the following architecture:

![aws reference architecture](../images/aws-infra-transparent.png)

For now, each cluster has its own VPC, subnets, NAT etc. VPC module is included inside the symplegma module, this is subject to change in the future as PR are welcomed to make the possibilities evolved and split modules.

## Requirements

* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html)
* [Terragrunt](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#install-terragrunt)
* [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

Git clone Symplegma main repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clusterfrak-dynamics/symplegma.git
```

Fetch the roles with `ansible-galaxy`:

```bash
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
```

## Terraform and Terragrunt

Terragrunt is used to enable multiple cluster and environments, also to enable remote state storage and locking with Terraform.

Terraform remote state is stored in an encrypted S3 bucket and state locking is done with AWS DynamoDB.

### Terragrunt modules

Symplegma is packaged in a [Terragrunt module](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt) available [here](https://github.com/clusterfrak-dynamics/symplegma/tree/master/contrib/aws/terraform).

### Terragrunt variables

Remote state specific variables:

```
{!contrib/aws/terraform/env/terraform.tfvars!}
```

Cluster specific variables:

```
{!contrib/aws/terraform/env/sample/symplegma/terraform.tfvars!}
```

## Creating the infrastructure

To init a new AWS cluster, simply run `./scripts/init-aws.sh $CLUSTER_NAME`

It will generate `inventory/aws/$CLUSTER_NAME` with the following directory structure:

```bash
sample
├── aws.py -> ../../../contrib/aws/inventory/aws.py
├── extra_vars.yml
├── group_vars
│   └── all
│       └── all.yml
├── host_vars
├── symplegma-ansible.sh -> ../../../contrib/aws/scripts/symplegma-ansible.sh
└── tf_module_symplegma
    └── terraform.tfvars
```

### Customizing the infrastructure

Terraform variable files come with sensible default for the `eu-west-1` region.

If you wish to change remote state configuration you can edit `$CLUSTER_NAME/terraform.tfvars`

If you wish to customize the infrastructure you can edit `$CLUSTER_NAME/tf_module_symplegma/terraform.tfvars`

One of the most important variable is `cluster_name` that allows you tu use AWS dynamic inventory with multiple cluster. We recommend this variables to be coherent throughout your files and equals to `$CLUSTER_NAME` defined earlier.

There is also a set of sensible default tags that you can customize such as `Environment` for example or add your own.

To avoid bloating the configuration files and unnecessary hard coded values, Terraform provider credentials are derived from your AWS SDK config. Make sure you are using the correct aws profile by setting your `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable.

### Initializing the infrastructure

Once everything is configured to your needs, just run:

```bash
terragrunt apply-all --terragrunt-source-update
```

Couples minute later you should see your instances spawning in your EC2 dashboard.

## Deploying Kubernetes with symplegma playbooks

### AWS Dynamic inventory

AWS dynamic inventory allows you to target a specific set of instances depending on the `$CLUSTER_NAME` you set earlier. You can configure the behavior of dynamic inventory by setting the following `ENV`:

* `export SYMPLEGMA_CLUSTER=$CLUSTER_NAME` : Target only instances belonging to this cluster.
* `export SYMPLEGMA_AWS_REGION=eu-west-1` : AWS region where instances are targeted.

To test the behavior of the dynamic inventory just run:

```bash
./inventory/aws/${CLUSTER_NAME}/aws.py --list
```

It should only return a specific subset of your instances.

!!! info
    These variables can be exported automatically when using the deployment script, but they can still be set manually for testing / manual deployment purposes.

### Customizing Kubernetes deployment

In the cluster folder, it is possible to edit Ansible variables:

* `group_vars/all/all.yml`: contains default Ansible variables.

```bash
{!inventory/sample-coreos/group_vars/all/all.yml!}
```

!!! info
    `ansible_ssh_bastion_host`, `kubernetes_api_server_address` and `kubernetes_api_server_port` can be automatically populated when using the deployment script but they can still be set manually for testing / manual deployment purposes.

* `extra_vars`: contains AWS cloud provider specific variables that you can override.

```bash
{!contrib/aws/extra_vars.yml!}
```

!!! info
    If you need to override control plane or kubelet specific parameters do it in `extra_vars.yml` as it overrides all other variables previously defined as per [Ansible variables precedence documentantion](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.7/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#variable-precedence-where-should-i-put-a-variable)

### Running the playbooks with deployment script

A simple (really, it cannot be simpler) deployment script can call Ansible and compute the necessary Terraform output for you:

```bash
{!contrib/aws/scripts/symplegma-ansible.sh!}
```

From the root of the repository just run your cluster deployment script:

```bash
./inventory/aws/${CLUSTER_NAME}/symplegma-ansible.sh
```

### Testing cluster access

When the deployment is over, `admin.conf` should be exported in `kubeconfig/$CLUSTER_NAME/admin.conf`. You should be able to call the Kubernetes API with `kubectl`:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/kubeconfig/${CLUSTER_NAME}/admin.conf

kubectl get nodes

```

## Running E2E test with Sonobuoy

If you want to test your cluster, you can use [Sonobuoy](https://github.com/heptio/sonobuoy) which run the standard conformance testing suite on your cluster.

Go to [Sonobuoy scanner](https://scanner.heptio.com/) and just follow the instructions, the test results should be available after 2/3h.
